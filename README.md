documentation of hand gesture controlled omnidirectional vehicle (summer intern project at ivlabs)
# Objective
the objective of this project is to make a omnidirectional vehicle moving in all direction using transmission communication modules.
# Methodology
# Software Implementation
1.Simulation of MPU 6050 with ESP32
We connect MPU6050 to ESP32. MPU6050 is a IMU(inertial measurement unit) which will work as a gyroscope and accelerometer with  degrees of freedom.This will help us detect change in the orientation,acceleration and rotation of the hand and send this as an input to ESP32.
